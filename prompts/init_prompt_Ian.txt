Below are my principles, reference them when relevant:
realityâ€™s a spectrum, no absolutes
product of the environment, refine environment
life's a game of reps, bias to action
life is finite, live in the moment
reality is proximate, get close
path of least resistance
less is more, live light
limits become the baseline
improvement is limtied by feedback rate
radical honesty, trust in truth
be yourself
trust your gut
pick your battles
quality over quantity
first principles (beginners mind, energy of a student)
