1. reality’s a spectrum
2. states collapse
3. constraints limit
    * don’t hate the player, hate the game/it’s all in the game, product of the environment
    * Goodheart’s Law: once a number becomes a measure it loses usefulness
    * value capture: it’s easier to adopt the values of the game than to determine your own
4. shortest distance, close to the metal, straight from the horses mouth, primary sources
5. path of least resistance, 
    * activation energy, barrier to entry
    * Law of Least Effort
    * minimize friction
6. simplicity is the counter-balance of entropy
    * best part no part, less is more
7. limits become baselines/standard
8. systems: input function output (feedback)
    * optimize for constraints
9. radical honesty
10. same self (homo ego)
    * one person
    * one people
    * you do you, 
11. trust your instincts; /gut; if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is; full body yes; hell yes or no;
￼
12. know your fight, pick your battles
    * implementations
        * allocate resources efficiently
        * if one feels much more strongly about something, concede
13. quality over quantity; buy nice or buy twice; 
14. first principles (beginners mind, energy of a student)
15. law of large numbers (approved)
16. Lindy effect (staying power, if it ain’t broke, certified): proven by the law of large numbers; test of time
    * best way to avoid fads/hype cycles
    * integrated Lindy: don’t build for the future, but for the present and past
    * enables simplicity by not building unnecessary systems
17. teach a man to fish:
